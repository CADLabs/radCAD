## Project Overview

---

A Python framework for modelling and simulating [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system). Models are structured using state transitions for encoding differential equations, or any other logic, as an example. Simulations are configured using methods such as parameter sweeps, Monte Carlo runs, and A/B testing. radCAD extends on [cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD). See [cadCAD.education](https://cadcad.education) for the most comprehensive cadCAD beginner course.


Goals:

- simple API for ease of use
- performance driven (more speed = more experiments, larger parameter sweeps, in less time)
- cadCAD compatible (standard functions, data structures, and simulation results)
- maintainable, testable codebase
